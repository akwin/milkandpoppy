                The reasons I cook

                <div class="description-love">
                    <p>Eating is a necessity but cooking is an art.</p>
                </div>
            </blockquote>
            <div class="thoughts">
                <p>I didn't realize the importance or necessity of cooking until i moved away from India. I could depend on
                    many external factors to obtain well-prepared delicious food - from mom's delicious meals to the many
                    wonders of indian street foods and in recent years, take out and home delivery. However, moving to Vancouver
                    brought about a big shift in terms of availability of foods that i liked and was used to. I could only
                    eat takeout for so long. And so my journey into the vast vast world of cooking began. Here are a few
                    things i have learnt until now. This list is by no means complete as you're always learning in the kitchen.
                    And out of it.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It's a life-saving skill to acquire.</li>
                    <li>The investment : returns ratio tops the charts. Spend a few minutes reading a recipe and playing with
                        good looking ingredients in the kitchen and reward yourself with a five star dinner.</li>
                    <li>With some effort, a bit of patience and practice, your meals will taste better than ever before. Mostly
                        because you will learn to cook according to your taste and you'll compare your own creations with
                        all other dishes.</li>
                    <li>Cooking gives you the opportunity to orchestrate something amazing - you take some ingredients, chop
                        them, mix them, cook them a certain way and magic happens! You are a creator - you've made that delicious
                        meal & you deserve all of it.</li>
                    <li>It helps you earn brownie points with every single relationship in your life. Cook with and for your
                        family and friends. It's a joy to see their wonder, exhilaration and satisfaction after successfully
                        impressing them with a good dish.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes, a warm bowl of delicious soup is all you need and being able to fulfill a need exactly to
                        perfection is a rare opportunity. And cooking can help you reach this accomplishment.</li>
                    <li>Cooking has never been a chore for me and shouldn't be for you too. It is a quiet time to be one with
                        your food, be in-charge of what you are eating and as a consequence on the path to eating healthy
                        and well. For me cooking is a fun way to wind down. It's exciting to pick new items in the grocery
                        store and transform them into something delicious.</li>
                    <li>You eventually develop your own personal stash of recipes.</li>
                </ol>
                So, whether you're a beginner or an expert, you're definitely someone who eats food, multiple times a day. Food is what makes
                us and keeps our bodies running and it would be worthwhile to be conscious of your dietary habits. And venture
                into the kitchen once in a while and treat yourself to a date. Also, share with me your reasons to cook!
